## TO-DO and observations
- This exercise is not paged as it is not allowed by the service. I think functionality like this should be paged in a real project.
- There is a date that has 60 seconds and by default Java assumes it as good as it transforms the extra seconds into minutes, therefore this transaction appears, although the seconds in the date as such is not correct.
- The description field should not come empty or null from the server, since in every transaction it should come at least with one concept, if it is not very empty or a text has to be invented for these occasions.
- Transactions could come with a type of icon that identifies it, to make it more visual.
